      <h2>A little about Casaldáliga's life:</h2>

      <p>Pere Casaldàliga i Pla CMF, known in Portuguese as Pedro Casaldáliga, was a Catalan-born Brazilian prelate of the Catholic Church who led the Territorial Prelature of São Félix, Brazil, from 1970 to 2005.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1928:</strong> was born on 16 February in Balsareny, Catalonia, Spain
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1952:</strong> was ordained a priest on 31 may, after joining the Claretian Seminary of Vic at the age of 9.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1968:</strong> moved to Brazil as a missionary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1970:</strong> Pope Paul VI named him Apostolic Administrator of the Territorial Prelate of São Félix. In <strong>1971</strong>, the Pope named him prelate of that jurisdiction and titular bishop of Altava.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the 1970s, the military regime ruling Brazil tried without success to force Casaldàliga to leave the country. His advocacy for indigenous peoples and peasants resulted in repeated death threats.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1972:</strong> he co-founded the <em>Conselho Indigenista Missionário</em>, an organ of the Episcopal Conference of Brazil that fights for the right to cultural diversity of indigenous peoples to strengthen its autonomy. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1976:</strong> Upon being informed that two women were being tortured at the local police station, he went there accompanied by Jesuit priest João Bosco Penido Burnier. After a strong discussion with the police, Father Burnier threatened to report them to the authorities, being then beaten and shot in the back of the head. After the seventh-day mass, the people went in procession to the door of the police station, freeing the prisoners and destroying the building. In that place ten years later, the <em>Sanctuary of the Martyrs of the Walk</em> was erected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the 1980s, he refused to make the required <em>ad limina</em> visits to Rome that bishops normally make every five years. He said he feared not being able to re-enter Brazil and said "The visits were bureaucratic and formal and did not lead to proper dialogue."</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1988:</strong> The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) and the Congregation of Bishops produced a statement for him to sign as an "acknowledgment of his errors". The statement decreed that he would not add political content to processions, would accept restrictions on his theological work, and only say Mass or preach outside of Brazil, especially in Nicaragua, with permission from the local bishop. He did not sign it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1993:</strong> Amnesty International showed concern for the safety of Bishop Casaldàliga when landowners hired gunmen to kill him.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1994:</strong> he supported the Zapatista Uprising, in Chiapas, Mexico.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2005:</strong> Pope John Paul II accepted Casaldàliga's resignation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2012:</strong> Casaldàliga had to flee his home, and the Federal Police hid him for two months after he received death threats from landowners from the region when he helped the Xavante people regain their land. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2020:</strong> he died due to respiratory problems aggravated by the Parkinson's disease. His body was buried on August 12 in São Félix do Araguaia, in the Karajá Cemetery, on the banks of the Araguaia River, where peasants and Indians who resisted land-grabbing in Mato Grosso were buried.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <p>His activity as a bishop had the following characteristics:<p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Evangelization without colonialism, linked to human promotion and the defense of the human rights of the poorest;</li>
        <li>Creation of Base Ecclesial Communities with leaders who are "leaven among the poor";</li>
        <li>Incarnation in life, in the struggles and hopes of the people;</li>
        <li>Participatory, co-responsible and democratic structure in the diocese.</li>
      </ol>
      
  <p>One of the most striking feature of his role as bishop was the fact that he preferred not to wear traditional ecclesiastical dress. Instead of the miter, a straw hat; in place of the ecclesial staff, an indigenous staff; instead of a gold ring, a tucum ring.</p>
